# FB2 Reader

## About

### Advantages

- Displaying the book as a regular web page with scrolling. Most e-readers only offer the option of viewing page by page, which is not very convenient for reading from a computer monitor.
- Saving downloaded books for later reading.
- Saving reading progress. You open books from where you left off last time.
- Viewing tooltips on mouse hover.
- Customizable styles for displaying book elements. You can customize styles as you like and save them in separate profiles, for example, you can set up a light and dark theme and switch between them in the future.
- Fixing the width of the text.
- Preserving scroll position during zoom.

### Disadvantages

- Works only with FB2.
- Books, settings, and progress are saved only in the current browser.

## TODO

- Добавить возможность кастомизации CSS-стилей.
- Добавить элементы интерфейса для возврата к странице выбора книги.
- Фиксация ширины текста.

- Проработать стили интерфейса.
